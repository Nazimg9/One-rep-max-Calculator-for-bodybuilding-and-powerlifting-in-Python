# One-rep-max-Calculator-for-bodybuilding-and-powerlifting-in-Python
Python Project:This estimates the most accurate ONE REP MAX by taking average of 1RM's of different formulas like,
Epley Formula,Brzycki Formula ,Lander's Formula,Mayhew Formula,Lombardi Formula,Wathen Formula ,O'Conner's Formula .
Max Repetition Weight formulas are intended to provide an estimate on the maximum weight one can lift without having to attempt such a lift. 
The max one rep weight is estimated based on the total number of reps lifted of a weight less than the weightlifter's established maximum. 
The motivation is to avoid injuries associated with lifting one's max.
